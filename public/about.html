        <h2> Who am i ? </h2>

        <p>my name is hassan, i’m 20 years old, i’m from egypt and i was studying chemistry in university, but i don’t like chemistry very much, i’ve always had passion for programming since i was 15 years old ,but i didn’t have the chance to learn programming because it was not really big deal back then, but last year, with the boom in all tech fields, i decided to make a bold decision, i dropped out and i started to chase my dream to be a full-time programmer and since then i’ve achieved milestone, 1000 hrs experience in web development field, and today (date), i started my freelancing journey and this is my first web i’ve ever made from scratch, and i’m really eager to meet new people and work with them through this big journey.</p>

        <h2>
           How i will build your website ?
        </h2>

        <ol class="how-i-will-list">
           <li><span class="bold">First phase ( design ) </span>: i will study your project carefully and then i will make a mockup for the project and then present it to you, if you don’t like it, then i will make another one for you, if you like it, then i will immediately start working on the next phase.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">second phase ( coding - front-end ) </span>: in this phase i will start to code the design made in the last phase, and in this phase i use tools and coding languages like <span class="pink">html</span> & <span class="pink">css</span> & <span class="pink">javascript</span> & <span class="pink">bootstrap</span> & <span class="pink">css tailwind</span> & <span class="pink">React.js</span>, these tools and languages are responsible of building & styling the Front-End of your website.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">Third phase ( coding - backend) </span>: coding the Front-end of your website is over, then it’s time to code the Back-End, Back-end is a term refers to backstaging of your website like linking your website front-End with databases, setting up a server for the website using <span class="pink">express.js</span> and linking website pages using <span class="pink">RestAPI</span> and to set all this technologies we need an environment, in our case i will use <span class="pink">Node.js</span> and the reason we use <span class="pink">Node.js</span> is most of the libraries we use is from <span class="pink">javascript</span> like <span class="pink">React.js</span> so Node will achieve sort of flexibility & harmony in your website, in case we need to deal with users data in your website we will use security methods like salting & hashing in your website and this help us to encrypt users sensitive data like passwords, email adress and card details.                                the last thing we will do in this phase is setting database and the most preferred way for me is to use <span class="pink">MongoDB</span> because it’s safe, reliable, and trusted by big companies to run mission critical databases.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">phase number 4 ( Testing )</span>: after coding the entire website, there’s just one phase stop us from launching it and this phase is Testing, at the end we don’t want a website with hundreds of mistakes, and in this phase i use tool called <span class="pink">cypress</span> to asure that your website will work flawless, fast, secure and functioning.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">last phase ( Hosting ) </span>: after substantial amount of milestones, we have reached the last phase, hosting you website, in this phase your website will be online, you can name your website whatever you want, and if this name (domain) is available, i will be able to book it and install it to your website, plus, i will install ssl certificate to make your website url start with (https) and this is important when it comes to users trust, this phase will be accomplished using <span class="pink">Heroku</span>.</li>
           <li><span class="bold">post hosting phase </span>: now you’re all set, your website is online on the internet, there is just few things you need, the first is you will recieve your source code documented in case you have another plan for maintaining your website, the second is if you don’t have a plan for maintaining your website, don’t worry, i’m here to help you, all you need to do is infrom me if you want me to be responsible for this task. </li>
